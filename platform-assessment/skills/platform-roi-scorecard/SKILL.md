name: platform-roi-scorecard
description: Build a developer-productivity and platform-ROI scorecard for a platform engineering team — combining DORA, SPACE, MVP-stage, and AI-workload metrics with a full dollar-value ROI calculation, survey + system-data measurement design, industry benchmark calibration, credibility/measurement audit, and adoption tracking. Use whenever the user needs to prove platform value to leadership, build a platform business case, justify AI infrastructure ROI, design a metrics program, design a developer survey, estimate the cost of a platform team, measure developer productivity, calculate ROI, or figure out why platform adoption or credibility is stalling. For industry/vertical benchmark positioning and peer patterns, use the sibling platform-industry-brief skill; for structuring and sizing the platform team itself, use platform-org-design-advisor.

# Platform ROI Scorecard

## Purpose
Produce a defensible, dollar-denominated case for a platform team's value — not vibes, not lines of code. Also diagnose (and fix) the "measurement paradox" where teams report improvement without ever having measured a baseline. Siblings: `asdlc-maturity-assessment` supplies the agent-maturity read that segments the measurement layer; `platform-org-design-advisor` produces the team cost model (headcount × salary benchmarks) this scorecard consumes; `platform-industry-brief` carries the full industry benchmark databank behind the calibration table.

## Core model to hold in your head

### Why traditional metrics fail here
Lines of code, story points, and commit counts were built for individual output tracking. They miss what platforms actually create: reduced friction (e.g., deploy time cut from hours to minutes), knowledge sharing (faster onboarding via standardized workflows), error prevention (guardrails catching issues pre-production), and cross-team efficiency (shared tools eliminating duplicate work). Don't let a stakeholder anchor the conversation on these metrics — redirect to the frameworks below.

### The three measurement frameworks, and when to use each
1. **DORA metrics** — system-level delivery health: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to recovery, change failure rate. Best for showing systemic improvement, especially to technical stakeholders and once a platform is past MVP.
2. **SPACE framework** — developer experience, five dimensions:
   - **S**atisfaction — surveys, NPS
   - **P**erformance — code quality, system reliability
   - **A**ctivity — reviews, deployments (concrete actions)
   - **C**ommunication — knowledge sharing, collaboration
   - **E**fficiency — workflow smoothness, reduced context switching
   Ties technical change to business outcome: higher satisfaction correlates with retention, which is a real dollar figure (see below).
3. **MVP-stage metrics** — for platforms too early for DORA/SPACE to be meaningful:
   - **Complexity Index** = 1 − (unique configurations ÷ total resources). Higher = more standardized.
   - **Onboarding Time** — time to a new developer's first meaningful PR.
   - **Service Creation Time** — end-to-end time to get a new service production-ready.

**Sequencing rule:** early-stage platforms should prioritize onboarding time, satisfaction, and service creation time (adoption/usability signals). As the platform matures, DORA metrics become the stronger signal of systemic engineering improvement. Don't demand DORA-level metrics from a 6-week-old platform.

### Measurement doctrine: survey data and system data are complementary — you need both
Every metric in the scorecard comes from one of two sources, and neither is sufficient alone:
- **System data** (CI/CD, version control, ticketing, deploy toolchain) gives a *continuous*, precise, granular view — but only of what is automatically collected and correlated. Grade every system-derived metric on the **three C's**: **completeness** (enough history in this system of record to support the claim — e.g., a real trend line, not two data points), **comprehensiveness** (captured across ALL relevant systems — time-to-market for a customer request may span the support tracker + requirements tool + agile board + deploy toolchain), and **correctness** (correlated without double-counting — the same item logged as a support ticket and a defect must be reconciled, not counted twice). System data also misses whatever happens outside the tools (un-checked-in config scripts, manual workarounds) and silently drifts stale when the stack changes but the collectors don't.
- **Survey data** gives a *periodic*, holistic view: respondents synthesize automation + process + culture in one pass, catch behavior that bypasses the tooling, and capture culture, job satisfaction, and burnout — which are **leading indicators** of delivery performance and retention. HR attrition data is a lagging proxy: by the time it moves, people have already left.

**Survey design rules** (bake these into any survey you produce):
- Survey the **doers** — people hands-on with the delivery system. Don't survey executives: they systematically overestimate maturity relative to practitioners.
- **20–25 minutes maximum** to protect participation and completion; run it **every 4–6 months** — more often burns respondents out.
- For frequency questions (deploys, releases), offer **log-scale response options** (on demand / weekly / monthly / quarterly / yearly) — practitioners answer reliably at that granularity, not at exact counts.
- Use tested, statistically valid question wording where possible; survey design is a discipline, not a form.

**Triangulation rule:** when survey and system data diverge sharply, that is a *debugging signal, not noise*. If engineers consistently report long build times while dashboards say builds are fast, suspect partial capture or a misconfigured collector before you suspect the engineers — if everyone close to the system says the same thing, treat their experience as a true data point. Investigate every large divergence; it usually exposes a gap in the system data.

### The five dimensions for selecting which metrics matter
Don't try to measure everything. Pick metrics across **velocity, security, quality, people, and cost**, and let business strategy decide the weighting (e.g., a go-to-market strategy demanding high release frequency selects velocity + quality first). Accept that this is a trade-off — document what you are choosing not to prioritize and why.

### AI-workload extension: when the platform serves AI/ML workloads
Platforms increasingly serve data scientists and ML engineers alongside app developers. Treat models, datasets, and inference endpoints as **versioned, deployable artifacts moving through build/test/production behind golden paths** — the same rigor as microservices — and extend the scorecard with a 6-metric AI velocity set:
1. **Time to first inference** — project kickoff to first production inference request.
2. **Template adoption rate** — % of AI projects using platform-provided templates/golden paths.
3. **GPU utilization** — are clusters efficiently used or sitting idle? (Scale-to-zero on idle inference clusters is the big cost lever.)
4. **Cost per inference** — the unit economics of AI workloads.
5. **Deployment frequency for models** — how often teams ship new model versions through CI/CD.
6. **Governance coverage** — % of AI workloads with complete audit trails (which data trained which model for which application).

Useful sanity-check questions: can a developer stand up a complete AI stack within ~48 hours? Deploy operational AI in weeks rather than months?

**Value-narrative framing — AI-enabled vs. AI-native:** *AI-enabled* means AI tools bolted into existing workflows (coding assistants, chat interfaces, occasional external API calls); *AI-native* means models and inference run as first-class, governed platform services embedded in business processes. The platform's AI ROI story is the measurable move from enabled to native — told with the six metrics above, not with tool-adoption counts.

**Skepticism flag:** treat vendor productivity and revenue claims about AI platforms skeptically — much of what circulates comes from illustrative scenarios, not measured customers. Apply the same discipline as everywhere else in this skill: no before/after baseline, no ROI claim.

### The ROI calculation
**ROI = (Total Value Generated − Total Cost) ÷ Total Cost**

**Costs** (often undercounted — audit for all of these):
- Initial implementation (engineering time, PoC, onboarding)
- Tooling (licenses, cloud usage, subscriptions)
- Enablement (training, docs, internal comms)
- Maintenance overhead (updates, monitoring, compliance, patching)
- Opportunity cost (what didn't get built because the platform did)
- Salary allocation — if engineers spend 50% of time on platform work, count 50% of their comp as platform cost. Calibrate the comp assumption against market reality: North America platform engineers average ~$161K, down year-over-year as the title mainstreams (industry survey, 2025).

**Value** (convert every technical win to a dollar figure):
- *Developer time saved* = hours saved/week × number of developers × hourly rate × 52
- *Faster feature delivery* = estimated revenue impact of shipping X weeks sooner
- *Reduced downtime* = hours of prevented outages × cost per hour of downtime
- *Tool consolidation* = eliminated license/support/maintenance spend

**Worked reference patterns** (use as sanity checks / illustrative benchmarks, not universal targets):
- A small team (~25 developers, 2-person platform team) can plausibly see ~180%+ ROI within ~6 weeks by combining developer-time savings with faster lead time — driven mostly by autonomy and lead-time gains, at fairly low annual cost (order of $200K).
- A larger org (~200 developers, 8-person platform team) can plausibly see ~200%+ ROI mixing cloud-cost savings from standardized provisioning with productivity gains — at meaningfully higher annual cost (order of $1M+), where a large chunk of the value shows up as direct infra savings, not just developer time.
- Treat these as illustrative shapes for how value breaks down (time savings + delivery speed vs. infra savings + productivity), not as numbers to promise a specific org.

### Timeline expectations
Set stakeholder expectations honestly: productivity improvements typically show up within 6–12 weeks of MVP deployment; comprehensive ROI measurement needs 6–12 months of adoption data. Industry pattern: mature orgs allocate roughly 10–20% of engineering capacity to platform work — use this as a sanity check on resourcing, not a target to hit.

### Benchmark calibration table (industry survey, 2025 — context-setting, not targets)
Ground the scorecard's expectations in where the industry actually is:

| Benchmark | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Annual platform budget under $1M | 47.4% of orgs |
| Orgs using DORA metrics to prove success | 40.8% |
| Orgs using time-to-market | 31.0% |
| Orgs using SPACE | 14.1% |
| Orgs that do not measure success at all | 29.6% (down from 45% the prior year) |
| Orgs running more than one platform | 55.9% |
| North America platform engineer salary | ~$161K average (down year-over-year) |
| Platform capacity in mature orgs | ~10–20% of engineering capacity |

How to use these: the salary figure anchors the cost model's salary-allocation line; the budget figure tells you whether the org's ask is in the industry mainstream (nearly half of platform initiatives run under $1M — often underfunded relative to expectations); the "29.6% don't measure" figure is your opener when diagnosing the measurement paradox — not measuring is common, and rapid improvement on it is achievable industry-wide; and multi-platform prevalence (55.9%) means the scorecard may need to cover several platforms, not one.

### The credibility/measurement audit (do this before building the scorecard)
A large share of platform teams report improvement without a real baseline — self-reported "vibes" outrun what's actually been measured. Before producing a scorecard, check for this gap explicitly:
- Ask: "What was the metric before, and what is it now?" If there's no before/after, you don't have an ROI claim yet — you have an anecdote.
- Push for a real experimental setup: baseline observation → statistical comparison → triangulation across at least two frameworks (e.g., DORA + SPACE), not a single number in isolation.
- If no measurement exists yet, don't skip to "let's calculate ROI" — first run a 2–4 week observation phase: pull existing data from CI/CD, ticketing, PR-merge rates, and onboarding metrics, cross-reference them, and find the low-hanging-fruit bottleneck before instrumenting anything new. Spreadsheets are a fine starting tool; don't let tooling be the blocker.

### Adoption as its own signal
Track adoption on an S-curve: slow initial uptake → rapid ramp → saturation. Measure users, voluntary usage (not just mandated usage), features delivered, services migrated. If adoption deviates from the expected S-curve, intervene with workshops/docs/onboarding — and if trust still doesn't follow after intervention, that's a legitimate signal to consider sunsetting the platform rather than forcing adoption. Voluntary usage is a stronger credibility signal than mandate-driven usage — call this out explicitly if the org's adoption is >30% mandate-driven.

## Workflow

1. **Audit measurement maturity first.** Determine if a real baseline exists at [YOUR ORGANIZATION / CLIENT]. If not, scope the deliverable down to "observation plan" rather than "ROI scorecard" and say so.
2. **Select metrics** across the five dimensions (velocity, security, quality, people, cost), explicitly tied to the org's stated business strategy — ask what the business is optimizing for if not stated. Pair every system-derived metric with a survey counterpart per the measurement doctrine — the scorecard needs both views.
3. **Choose the right framework mix** by platform stage: MVP metrics if <3 months old, SPACE + emerging DORA if establishing, full DORA + SPACE if mature — plus the 6-metric AI velocity set if the platform serves AI/ML workloads.
4. **Design the data collection**: a practitioner survey built to the design rules (survey doers not executives, 20–25 minutes max, every 4–6 months, log-scale frequency options) paired with system data pulled via first-party connectors (see below), graded on the three C's. Plan up front to investigate any survey-vs-system divergence as a debugging signal.
5. **Build the ROI calculation**: enumerate every cost category above (don't let the user skip salary allocation or opportunity cost), then convert each value driver to dollars with the formulas above, showing the math. Sanity-check budget and salary assumptions against the benchmark calibration table.
6. **Add the adoption view**: current position on the S-curve, voluntary vs. mandated %, and an intervention recommendation if off-curve.
7. **Tailor the write-up to audience**: for executives, lead with the dollar ROI number, use external benchmarks, tie to strategic goals (time-to-market, retention), keep it visual and concise. For dev teams, lead with workflow/pain-point improvements and concrete before/after numbers, not dollars.
8. **Output.** A scorecard with: measurement-maturity finding, selected metrics + why, the survey + system-data collection plan, the ROI calculation with full cost/value breakdown, adoption S-curve position, and two versions of the summary (exec framing / dev-team framing).

### System-data collection via first-party connectors
When pulling system data, prefer vendor-owned (first-party) MCP servers over hand-built exports — they inherit the org's existing auth and permission trimming. Map scorecard inputs to connectors (examples; the structure is tool-agnostic):
- **PR / commit / deploy metrics** (deployment frequency, lead time, review latency) → GitHub MCP server (repos, pull requests, Actions, deployments), Azure DevOps MCP (repos, PRs, builds), or GitLab MCP (MRs, pipelines — beta, gated behind Premium/Ultimate + Duo licensing).
- **Work-item lead time / backlog health** → Atlassian Remote MCP (Jira, plus Compass service catalog for attribution), Azure DevOps boards, or GitHub issues/projects.
- **Cloud cost** (for the cost side of the ROI model) → managed AWS MCP Server (Cost Explorer and Budgets reachable via call_aws — the strongest first-party cost surface), Azure MCP Server (resource + monitor queries; dedicated cost surface is partial), GCP via BigQuery billing export queried through the Google Cloud MCP servers (indirect).
- **Collaboration / onboarding signals** (meeting load, knowledge silos, who-works-with-whom) → Microsoft Work IQ MCP servers (people graph, Teams/mail semantics — preview, requires an M365 Copilot license) or Google Workspace MCP servers (Calendar/Drive/Chat/Gmail — developer preview).

Caveats to state in the scorecard's methodology notes: several of these connectors are preview or license-gated; usage dashboards often lag (~2 days is common), so don't read yesterday's adoption dip as real; users with telemetry disabled are invisible to system data (one more reason surveys are mandatory); and connector availability changes fast — verify at engagement time rather than assuming this list still holds.

## Guardrails
- Never produce a polished ROI number without first checking whether a real baseline exists — surface the measurement gap instead of papering over it.
- Don't let "lines of code" or story points into the scorecard as a legitimate productivity metric.
- Be explicit when illustrative benchmark numbers are being used for shape/pattern rather than as a promised outcome for this specific org.
- Never build the case on system data alone or surveys alone — the measurement doctrine requires both; investigate divergence between them instead of averaging it away.
- Don't survey executives as a proxy for practitioner reality, and don't import vendor case-study or AI-productivity claims as evidence — require a measured before/after baseline.

## Suggested effort
Max — this is a full business-case document, not a single number.
