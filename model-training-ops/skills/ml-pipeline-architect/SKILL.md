description: Design automated ML training pipelines on Kubernetes using Argo Workflows or Kubeflow Pipelines — the full step taxonomy from data ingestion/versioning through validation, feature engineering, train/tune, evaluation, registration, deployment, and feedback/skew detection, plus the four-trigger automation taxonomy (GitOps commit, new-data event, schedule, statistical drift), step caching, and spot/preemptible training economics. Use whenever the user asks to design a training pipeline, retraining pipeline, or continuous training (CT) loop; wants to automate model retraining when new data arrives or drift is detected; asks "Argo vs Kubeflow vs Airflow vs MLflow vs TFX" or which orchestrator to pick; mentions pipeline steps, DAGs for ML, data-quality gates, evaluation gates, conditional model registration, pipeline parameters, step caching/memoization, or training on spot instances with checkpointing; or asks how to move from one-off training scripts to repeatable pipelines. For what each run must log and registry promotion rules use the sibling experiment-registry-standard skill; for choosing the distributed-training topology inside the training step use distributed-training-advisor; for graduating a researcher notebook into a first pipeline use notebook-to-production.

# ML Pipeline Architect

## Purpose
Turn one-off training scripts into parameterized, automated, cached, cost-aware pipelines on the org's managed Kubernetes (Lambda GPU cloud — no SageMaker/Azure ML/Vertex; the stack is Argo Workflows/Kubeflow + MLflow + S3-compatible object storage). Design the step graph, choose the trigger model, pick the orchestrator with a defensible rule, and engineer the cost profile (caching + preemptible GPUs). Pipelines exist so researchers stop manually rerunning scripts every time new data arrives and so bad data fails fast instead of producing a plausible-looking bad model.

## Core model to hold in your head

### MLOps maturity — the three stages
- **v1.0 — Manual**: build, train, tune, deploy by hand (notebooks and scripts).
- **v2.0 — Orchestrated**: pipelines exist but a human starts them.
- **v3.0 — Automated**: pipelines start themselves from *deterministic* triggers (code commit, new data, schedule) or *statistical* triggers (drift, bias, explainability divergence).

Rules that follow:
- Diagnose where the team is, then design for exactly one stage up — don't sell v3.0 drift-triggered retraining to a team without a working v2.0 pipeline.
- Know when *not* to build: during rapid feature/model/hyperparameter exploration a pipeline's rigidity hurts — deploy pipelines when training becomes regular.
- Even in the lab, the simplest pipeline (data check → train → evaluate) improves exploration: fewer subtle bugs, lineage for free, and infrastructure that scales past the laptop.
- Pipelines pay for themselves in avoided incidents: small upstream application changes routinely introduce quality issues (values out of range, schema drift) that a model will happily train through and then hurt the business in production.

### The step taxonomy (what each stage validates)
Every effective training pipeline is some subset of these steps, in order. Each step declares typed inputs/outputs (object-storage URIs) so the orchestrator can pass artifacts, cache, and parallelize:

| Step | Does | Validates / gates |
|---|---|---|
| Data ingestion & versioning | Read raw data (DB, object store, stream); convert to pipeline format (Parquet/CSV/JSONL); version raw *and* transformed sets | Both dataset versions recorded — the lineage anchor |
| Data analysis & validation ("step 0") | Schema, ranges, null rates, class balance, bias checks | **Raise a pipeline exception on bad data before any GPU spend.** Data-quality issues are the #1 cause of bad pipelines; a model can "train successfully" on garbage |
| Feature engineering | Transform to model inputs (tokenization, embeddings); balance and split train/validation/test; publish shared features | Split ratios and balancing recorded as parameters; features reusable org-wide |
| Model training & tuning | Train with a hyperparameter set; optionally HPO loop (random/Bayesian, early stopping) | Objective metric extracted per run; repeat until sufficient |
| Model evaluation | Score against the held-out test split; confusion matrix/AUC/task metrics; segment-level checks (per-category bias) | Writes a metrics artifact (evaluation.json) consumed by the gate |
| Conditional registration & deployment | Compare metrics artifact to threshold; register version + metadata only if passed; deploy to staging on approval, production on second approval | The condition step: below-threshold models never enter the registry. Separate *model-build* (researcher-owned, to staging) from *model-deploy* (platform-owned, to production) for access control |
| Feedback & skew detection | Monitor business metrics; compare live input/prediction distributions to the training baseline | Training-serving skew or drift → emits the retrain trigger (closing the v3.0 loop) |

**Parameterize everything** that varies between runs, as first-class pipeline parameters with defaults, not hardcoded values:
- Data: input URI, dataset version, split percentages, balancing flags.
- Model: hyperparameters (learning rate, sequence length, epochs), base-model/image tags.
- Gates: metric thresholds, approval toggles.
This is what lets one pipeline definition serve experimentation (override a param) and production (defaults + trigger) — and what makes A/B/multi-armed-bandit variants cheap: run the same pipeline concurrently with different parameter sets to train and deploy competing versions.

### The four-trigger taxonomy (a design decision, not an afterthought)
Choose deliberately per pipeline; most orgs need two or three:

| Trigger | Mechanism on K8s | When it's right | Watch out |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitOps commit | CI (GitHub Actions) on merge to the pipeline/training-code repo submits the workflow | Code or config changed — model must be rebuilt to stay reproducible | Keep build-and-register separate from deploy; deploy needs its own approval |
| New-data event | Object-store bucket notification (S3-compatible event → webhook/Argo Events → workflow) | Data lands irregularly; freshness drives value | Don't fire per-object — batch/debounce; consider incremental training on the new slice |
| Schedule | Argo CronWorkflow / K8s CronJob (cron syntax) | Steady data flow; predictable cost windows; simplest to reason about | Wasteful if data rarely changes — pair with a "data changed?" first step that short-circuits |
| Statistical drift | Monitoring job compares live distributions vs training baseline (data drift, model-quality drift, bias drift, feature-attribution drift); alert fires the pipeline | Mature teams (v3.0); retrain exactly when needed | Requires a baseline captured at training time and prediction logging; tune thresholds to avoid retrain storms |

### Orchestrator selection

| Option | What it is | Choose when | Decision rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Argo Workflows** | K8s-native workflow engine; CRD-based; each DAG step = a pod; retries, artifacts, parallelism; underlies Kubeflow Pipelines, Katib, Seldon | K8s-first shop, general-purpose (ML + batch + CI/CD), minimal platform overhead | **Default here** — the org is already on managed K8s and Argo doubles for non-ML batch |
| **Kubeflow Pipelines** | ML-specific layer on K8s (with Notebooks, Katib HPO, KServe serving); DAGs, artifact repo, metadata/lineage, step caching | You want the integrated ML platform (notebooks + HPO + serving + pipelines) and accept operating it | Pick if the team will use ≥2 other Kubeflow components; it's a platform to run, not just a library — budget real ops time |
| **Apache Airflow** | Mature ETL/data-engineering orchestrator; huge operator library | Airflow already runs the org's data pipelines; ML DAGs ride existing rails | Never introduce Airflow *for* ML; adopt only if it's incumbent. Has built-in Dask support |
| **MLflow (Projects/recipes)** | Experiment tracking + packaging with *limited* workflow support | Lightweight chaining of steps during research | Not an orchestrator — pair it with Argo/Kubeflow as the tracking layer, never as the DAG engine |
| **TFX** | Python component libraries covering every pipeline step; runs *on top of* an orchestrator; distributed processing via Apache Beam | Deep TensorFlow shop wanting opinionated structure | Rare here (PyTorch-leaning research org); adds a Beam learning curve; limited non-TF support |

### Step caching (cost + iteration speed)
Most engines can skip a step whose inputs haven't changed: cache key = input artifacts + parameters (+ image); on hit, prior outputs are reused and the pipeline continues. Kubeflow Pipelines has native step caching; Argo has memoization (cache key + ConfigMap-backed cache with TTL).
- Design steps deterministic so a cache hit is actually safe to reuse.
- Key on dataset *version*, not file path — a path-keyed cache silently serves stale features after the data changes.
- Set an expiry (`expire_after`/TTL); never cache the evaluation/condition gate.
- Payoff is largest for expensive feature engineering (tokenization/embedding of a large corpus) sitting upstream of many training iterations — and for restart-after-failure, where completed steps replay from cache instead of re-running.

### Spot/preemptible training economics
Preemptible GPU capacity is the single biggest training cost lever, and it only works with engineering:
- **Checkpointing is mandatory** — write checkpoints to object storage on an interval; on preemption the replacement pod resumes from the last checkpoint instead of restarting. Modern frameworks (PyTorch, TF) tolerate node loss but need explicit checkpoint/restore code and config.
- Bound the blast radius: set a max wait/run time; cap retries; make steps idempotent so a re-run is safe.
- Mix pools: run the head/orchestration and short critical steps on-demand; long training steps on preemptible nodes.
- Multi-node jobs on spot amplify the gang-scheduling problem — see distributed-training-advisor for the Kueue/Volcano caveat.
- Remaining levers: step caching (above), early-stopping HPO, right-sized instance types per step (CPU pods for prep/eval, GPU only for train).
- Track pipeline cost per run as a first-class metric alongside model quality — a retraining trigger that fires too often is a budget bug, and you can't tune what you don't measure.

## Workflow
1. **Inventory the current loop.** For [the team's model], map how training happens today onto the maturity stages: who runs what, where data/artifacts live, what's manual. Identify the pain (stale models? bad-data incidents? GPU bill?).
2. **Draw the step graph.** Instantiate the taxonomy — name each step, its container, its typed inputs/outputs (object-storage URIs), its parameters, and its validation/gate. Insist on step 0 (data validation) and the conditional registration gate with an explicit metric threshold.
3. **Choose the orchestrator** with the table above; record the decision rule invoked (incumbency, platform appetite, K8s-native default).
4. **Choose triggers.** Pick from the four-trigger taxonomy per pipeline; specify the mechanism (CI job, bucket event, CronWorkflow, monitor alert) and debounce/short-circuit behavior.
5. **Engineer cost.** Mark cacheable steps and their cache keys; mark preemptible-safe steps and their checkpoint URIs + resume logic; assign CPU vs GPU node pools per step.
6. **Wire tracking and registry.** Every training/eval step logs to MLflow; registration follows the promotion criteria from `experiment-registry-standard`. Lineage must let you walk from any deployed model back to raw-dataset version.
7. **Define the human gates.** Staging deploy on registration approval; production deploy on a second approval; name the approver roles (researcher vs platform).
8. **Output.** A pipeline design doc: step table (image, inputs, outputs, params, gate), trigger spec, orchestrator decision + rule, caching/spot plan with checkpoint locations, tracking/registry integration points, and a skeleton workflow manifest (Argo `WorkflowTemplate` or Kubeflow pipeline definition) the team can fill in.

## Guardrails
- No pipeline without a data-validation step that can fail the run before training spends GPU hours.
- No unconditional registration — a metric-threshold condition step guards the registry, and evaluation runs on a held-out test split, never training data.
- Don't recommend Kubeflow to a team that only needs pipelines; don't recommend Airflow unless it's already the org's incumbent.
- Never enable spot/preemptible training without checkpoint-and-resume demonstrated in a test run.
- Keep model-build and model-deploy as separately-permissioned phases; researchers promote to staging, not production.
- Statistical-drift triggers require a stored training baseline and prediction logging — don't promise v3.0 without them.
- Cache keys must include dataset version and parameters; a cache keyed on file path silently serves stale features.
- This org runs OSS on Lambda managed K8s — translate any managed-service pattern (SageMaker Pipelines etc.) to Argo/Kubeflow + MLflow + object storage rather than recommending the service.

## Suggested effort
Medium-high — one session for the design doc (steps 1–7); a second to pair on the skeleton manifest and a smoke-run with caching and a forced preemption test.
