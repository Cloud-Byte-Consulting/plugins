# GPU Workload Troubleshooter

## Purpose
Walk a broken GPU workload from symptom to root cause along a fixed decision tree, with the exact command at each step — instead of the usual flailing between "add more tolerations" and "delete the node". Built for research clusters on managed K8s (Lambda): hardware and node-image layers escalate to the provider with evidence; everything above is yours to fix.

## Core model to hold in your head

**The GPU scheduling chain** — every failure is a broken link; find the link, not the symptom:

```
driver on node → container toolkit → device plugin DaemonSet registers nvidia.com/gpu with kubelet
→ node advertises allocatable GPUs → scheduler matches pod (limits + tolerations + selectors/affinity)
→ [if no fit: autoscaler provisions a node whose pool constraints intersect the pod's requirements]
→ kubelet + device plugin allocate the device → container starts → model loads → probes pass
```

**Extended-resource semantics you must hold**: GPUs are non-fractionable extended resources; set them in `limits` (requests auto-set equal — differing values are a validation error; requests-only is invalid). No overcommit. A GPU is reserved for the pod's whole lifecycle even if idle. Under time-slicing/MIG the *unit* changes (virtual GPU / slice) but the semantics don't — `nvidia.com/gpu: 10` allocatable on a 1-GPU node means time-slicing is active (gpu-sharing-advisor).

**Two different "won't run" families**: rejected at *creation* (`Forbidden: exceeded quota` — a ResourceQuota admission failure; fix quota or request, see researcher-tenancy-provisioner) vs stuck *Pending* after creation (scheduling — this tree).

## The decision tree

### 1. Pod is Pending
```
kubectl describe pod <pod> | grep -A5 Events
kubectl get pod <pod> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="PodScheduled")]}'
```
Branch on the FailedScheduling message:

**A. `Insufficient nvidia.com/gpu`** (e.g., `0/2 nodes are available: 2 Insufficient nvidia.com/gpu`). Check what nodes actually advertise:
```
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPUs:.status.allocatable."nvidia\.com/gpu"
kubectl get node <gpu-node> -o jsonpath='{.status.allocatable}' | jq .
```
- **Allocatable shows 0 / field absent on a GPU node → device plugin problem.** The #1 signature. Verify the DaemonSet exists, is scheduled on that node, and is healthy:
  ```
  kubectl get ds -A | grep -i -e nvidia -e device-plugin
  kubectl get pods -n <plugin-ns> -o wide | grep <node>
  kubectl logs -n <plugin-ns> <plugin-pod>
  ```
  Common causes: plugin DaemonSet's nodeSelector/tolerations don't match the node; node image lacks the NVIDIA driver/toolkit (ask Lambda which node images are GPU-enabled); plugin crashed after a driver upgrade. No device plugin = scheduler is blind to GPUs no matter what the hardware has.
- **Allocatable > 0 but all consumed → capacity.** `kubectl describe node <node> | grep -A8 "Allocated resources"` shows GPU requests vs capacity. Either autoscaling should add nodes (branch D) or sharing should stretch them (gpu-sharing-advisor).

**B. `node(s) had untolerated taint {nvidia.com/gpu: true}`** — pod lacks the toleration for the GPU pool taint. Fix the workload:
```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "nvidia.com/gpu"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```
This is the most common self-inflicted wound: pools taint GPU nodes deliberately; every GPU pod needs the matching toleration. The inverse mistake — *removing the taint* to make things fit — invites CPU workloads onto GPU nodes; never do it.

**C. `didn't match node selector/affinity`** — pod pins something no node (or pool) offers, e.g. `nodeSelector: {karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-gpu-name: a100}` on an L4-only fleet, or a label misspelling (`nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"` requires GPU feature discovery to be running). Compare pod spec vs `kubectl get nodes --show-labels`. Remember tolerations only *allow*, selectors *attract* — a pod needs both to land on tainted GPU nodes.

**D. Pod is Unschedulable but no new node appears.** Check in order:
1. Is the pod actually marked unschedulable? PodScheduled reason must be `Unschedulable`. Pods waiting on PVC binding, image pulls, or init containers do **not** trigger node autoscaling.
2. Autoscaler logs — e.g. Karpenter: `kubectl -n karpenter logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter --all-containers=true --tail=100 | grep -i -e unschedulable -e "no.*match" -e error`. Look for "Unable to schedule pod": it means **no node pool's constraints intersect the pod's requirements** (pod demands GPU type/zone/arch that no pool allows). Fix the pool requirements or the pod's.
3. Pool at its aggregate limit (`limits: nvidia.com/gpu: "10"` reached) — raise deliberately, it's the spend cap.
4. Provider capacity/quota: insufficient-capacity errors usually retry through; account quota errors don't. On Lambda ask about GPU availability per type and account limits; broaden acceptable GPU types/zones if the pool is overly narrow.

### 2. Node launched but pods still Pending
```
kubectl get nodeclaims          # Karpenter-style provisioners
kubectl describe nodeclaim <name>
```
Signature: **`Initialized: False` with "gpu resource not registered"** — the instance is up, but the device plugin never registered `nvidia.com/gpu` on it. Causes: node image without driver/toolkit (wrong image family for GPU — confirm with Lambda which images are accelerated), device plugin DaemonSet not landing (selector/toleration), or GPU Operator still initializing. Also check `startupTaints`: CNIs/agents that taint nodes during init must be declared to the autoscaler or it misreads readiness and can churn extra nodes.

### 3. GPU node unhealthy
Node-monitoring agents surface granular conditions; **`AcceleratedHardwareReady: False`** = GPU hardware failure, typically remediated fast (Karpenter Node Auto Repair force-replaces after 10 min vs 30 for generic conditions). Evidence gathering:
```
kubectl describe node <node> | grep -A12 Conditions
kubectl debug node/<node> -it --image=nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04 -- nvidia-smi   # if permitted
# DCGM: check DCGM_FI_DEV_XID_ERRORS, DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_TEMP in Prometheus
```
On managed K8s, failed GPU hardware is the provider's to replace: cordon/drain the node, open a ticket with Lambda including node name, XID errors, and timestamps; verify auto-repair/replacement behavior with them. Unhealthy-GPU pods often show as stuck ContainerCreating or CrashLoop *despite* the node looking Ready — trust DCGM/XID over the Ready condition.

### 4. Scheduled, but CrashLoopBackOff / restarts during model load
```
kubectl describe pod <pod>      # exit code, restart reason, events
kubectl logs <pod> --previous   # what it printed before dying
```
- **Killed by probes, not crashing**: exit 137 + "Liveness probe failed" events + clean logs = the kubelet is killing a healthy-but-slow server. Large models take minutes to pull weights and warm up; default probes assume seconds. Fix with a startupProbe budgeted to worst-case load, keeping liveness tight afterward:
  ```yaml
  startupProbe:
    httpGet: { path: /health, port: 8080 }
    periodSeconds: 10
    failureThreshold: 60        # 10m budget: threshold × period ≥ worst-case model load
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet: { path: /health, port: 8080 }
    periodSeconds: 10
    failureThreshold: 3
  readinessProbe:               # gate on model actually loaded, not TCP-up
    httpGet: { path: /ready, port: 8080 }
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```
- **Slow image pulls masquerading as hangs**: multi-GB GPU images (5 GB+) pull for minutes; `describe pod` shows the Pulled event with timing (a measured case: 1m16s cold vs 654ms with node-side pre-caching). Persistent pull slowness during scale-out → pre-cache images / mount models from PVC or object storage instead of baking into the image (gpu-autoscaling-engineer covers the cold-start design).
- **Genuine crash on load** → branch 5.

### 5. OOM: host RAM vs VRAM — different failures, different fixes

| Signal | It is | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pod OOMKilled, exit code 137, `describe` shows reason OOMKilled | **Host RAM** — container breached its memory limit (model loading commonly stages weights through CPU RAM, spiking far above steady state) | Raise `resources.limits.memory` (size for load-time peak, not steady state); check LimitRange defaults aren't clamping (a namespace default of 8Gi silently OOMs a 13B load) |
| App log shows `CUDA out of memory` / `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`, pod Running or CrashLooping with a Python/CUDA stack trace, no OOMKilled reason | **VRAM** — the GPU's memory is exhausted; Kubernetes limits don't govern VRAM | Smaller batch/context/precision (quantize), bigger GPU or MIG slice, or fewer co-tenants: under time-slicing/MPS there is **no VRAM protection** — a neighbor can consume the memory your pod needs. Check `DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` vs `FB_FREE` per GPU and who else is on the card |

Sporadic VRAM OOM only at busy hours on shared nodes = co-tenant contention → move the workload to an isolated MIG slice or exclusive GPU (gpu-sharing-advisor decision table).

## Quick reference

```
kubectl describe pod <pod>                                          # events: the first read, always
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPUs:.status.allocatable."nvidia\.com/gpu"
kubectl get ds -A | grep -i nvidia                                  # device plugin present?
kubectl get nodeclaims && kubectl describe nodeclaim <n>            # provisioning status conditions
kubectl -n karpenter logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter --all-containers=true -f --tail=20
kubectl get pod <pod> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq       # PodScheduled reason
kubectl logs <pod> --previous                                       # pre-crash output
kubectl get events -n <ns> --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -20
kubectl get quota -n <ns>                                           # admission-time rejections
```

## Guardrails
- Fix the broken link; never blanket-fix: no `privileged: true`, no taint removal, no quota bump, no probe deletion just to make a symptom disappear — each converts a visible failure into an invisible one.
- Read status conditions (pods, nodes, NodeClaims) before logs — provisioners put the diagnosis in `describe` output.
- Prefer centralized logs over `kubectl logs` for anything historical; pod logs die with the pod.
- On shared GPUs, per-pod symptoms can have per-*card* causes — always establish who else is on the device before blaming the workload.
- Hardware and node-image faults are provider-side on managed K8s: collect evidence (conditions, XID, timestamps), cordon, escalate to Lambda — don't burn hours reinstalling drivers on nodes you don't image.
- After any fix, verify the *chain*, not the pod: allocatable resources correct → schedules → loads → serves → scales.

## Suggested effort
Low per incident when the tree is followed (most cases resolve at step 1A/1B in minutes). Recurring incidents of the same class = a platform defect — route to the owning sibling skill (autoscaling, sharing, tenancy) instead of re-diagnosing.
